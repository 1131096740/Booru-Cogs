This repository will be used to host my *booru-related cogs. They're used to fetch images.

To install any of these cogs, make sure you're at least at commit [71240e5](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot/commit/71240e56a0245eb68054c86a5a6236a1a2650fd7) of Red-Discordbot, then add the repository.

You can then list and install the available cogs.  
`[p]cog list booru`
